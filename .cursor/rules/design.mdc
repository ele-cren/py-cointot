# Design System

## UI Framework

- Use **ShadcnUI** and **Tailwind CSS**

## Spacing & Grid System

- Primary grid: **8px increments** (8, 16, 24, 32, 40, 48...)
- Secondary grid: **4px increments** (8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 28...) - only when absolutely necessary

## Layout Principles

- **Proximity principle**: Related elements should be placed closer to each other
